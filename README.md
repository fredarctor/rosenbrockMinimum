# secondYearProjects
This is a collection of the projects I completed during my second year at the University of Bath.

The Frank-Hertz experiment was the first of the year, as well as my first proper experience with handling large amounts of data. Ultimately it was nothing complicated, which thankfully made for a smooth but challenging
introduction to data analysis using a couple Python libraries.

Up next was writing a C program to find the minimum of Rosenbrock's parabolic valley using the downhill simplex method. I had a lot of fun with this project! Though initially finding some elements of the language frustrating,
I came to appreciate the bare-bones nature which made me feel as if I truly understood the whole program.

Finally, the Extended Project was a brilliant opportunity to make use of the openCV library. I had seen it demonstrate previously in the use of object recognition in images or live video which certainly piqued my interest,
and so I jumped at the chance to put it to use with this project. Furthermore I become familiarised more with manipulating directories with Python which I am certain will be insipensable experience down the line.
