Though the smallest project of the three, I enjoyed this one immensely. It was my first time making a proper project in C, as well as something beyond just processing data. In essence it is an example of
the Nelder-Mead method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method) with some smaller additions as part of the course.

I have included just the code itself here as there really wasn't anything else adding much of value that couldn't be found on the above Wiki page.
