Due to the size of the project (~1000 images in total) I have only included the code, raw images, and processed images for one of the sets of data.
Fortunately this is all that is really needed as all other code is basically the same with minor tweaks and file name changes with the same going for
the raw data/processed images. 

My use of openCV in this project really opened my eyes to not only how instrumental modern computing software is in physics today but also to how easy
it is to access; I was truly astounded with the level of accuracy our group achieved using only my old laptop and a phone camera. Hopefully some of that 
feeling gets through to anyone else viewing this (unfortunately small) part of the project.

Also, please note that almost everything refers to blackCard as the laser was reflected onto black card.
